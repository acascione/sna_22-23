# 2023 Final Project

This is a template repository for the 2023 final project of the Social Network Analysis course at University of Pisa.

## Report Abstract

In this report, our goal is to comprehend and analyze a network of Spotify artists utilizing techniques from network science.
The initial section of our research is dedicated to explaining the criteria underlying the extraction and graph-building process. This involves a thorough exploration of standard network science quantitative analysis methods, examining the network’s characterization, and comparing it to synthetically constructed graphs. Moving forward, we delve deeper into the study of the network’s properties. This includes a comparative analysis of different algorithms for solving a static community discovery task, as well as unsupervised and supervised link prediction tasks. 

In conclusion, we try to understand how album covers extracted from artists’ networks are related to internal communities inside the graph and consider if the knowledge extracted is sufficient to predict the artist’s main genre based on the associated album, given a simple machine learning model.
